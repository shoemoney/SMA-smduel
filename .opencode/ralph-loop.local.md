lets do a infiniate improving loop each time ask a random state of the art vision enabled flash model (gemini 3.8 flash, latest glm, etc) to find 5 things to improve with reasons and suggestions take all feedback create milestones phases and todos. ask for feedback on all key elements of this game from an advisorial reviewer. provide them with any items they need to conduct a detailed review.  execute the plan then restart the loop with a new reviewer until you have asked all the vision enabled latest models on open router.  do not stop until i tell you to. 

## Log

Reviewers asked (16 of 82 vision models):
1. google/gemini-3.8-flash      -> title wordmark, constructor (3 bugs incl. one I missed), city motorway-through-wall
2. openai/gpt-5.4-mini         -> radar instrument, condition dashboard, player/opponent contrast, title hierarchy
3. qwen/qwen3.5-122b-a10b      -> road lane markings (carried x2), preview/menu contrast, radar rings (claim WRONG - checked)
4. deepseek/deepseek-v4.1-flash -> car silhouette, empty-feed pill + route progress bar, radar weight
5. inclusionai/ling-3.0-flash-vl -> seed printed twice (FIXED); wall/radar/constructor claims WRONG at full res
                                  -> root cause: 900px review images. Raised to 1280px.
6. z-ai/glm-5.3-flash          -> unfitted armour shown GREEN (FIXED); LEGALITY pushed off-screen by MY
                                  iteration-2 preview growth (FIXED); ground blockiness (nearest sampler, recorded)

RECURRING FALSE-FINDING CLASS: radar rings/sweep, city wall, constructor preview
reported "missing/empty" - all PRESENT at full res. Cause: review-image downscale.
Fixed at source by raising review captures 900px -> 1280px.
A first radar fix (mask-image rim ticks) corrupted CSS and stripped chrome off
every HUD panel - caught in a screenshot, reverted, redone as weight-only.

7. bytedance-seed/seed-1.6-flash -> constructor onboarding copy too quiet (FIXED, 3 steps);
                                  banner "cut off" (WRONG - reads in full)
                                  city waypoint (EXECUTED iteration 8: beacon, 2 bugs found)

8. (no new reviewer - executed iteration 7 carry) -> CITY WAYPOINT beacon
   2 invisible bugs: layer 3 has no buffer (silently dropped); PNG writer set white RGB
   on transparent px so the keyer erased the subject. Capacity guard caught the
   missing count (95 > 94) - first live catch for that check.

9. qwen/qwen3-vl-235b-a22b-thinking -> ALL FIVE CHECKED, NONE HELD UP:
     - "critical text is dark maroon #8B0000, <2:1 contrast" -> WRONG. Token is
       #ff5570; measured 6.13:1 on the panel surface. Every status colour clears
       WCAG AA (ok 10.88, damaged 10.39, critical 8.08, destroyed 6.13).
     - "'(empty)' is #333 on black, 1.5:1" -> WRONG. .sm-builder__row-value sets
       no colour, so it inherits --ui-ink (#e9eff6, ~15:1).
     - "city road is disconnected white segments" -> WRONG. That is the perimeter
       WALL (prop-citywall), a segmented barrier, verified at full res.
     - "radar sweep and blips identical dark green" -> the practice arena has no
       contacts at all (correct); contacts use --ui-ink, not the sweep colour.
     - "menu box merges with the backdrop" -> it has a cyan border and the
       selected row is a bright accent fill over glass.
     This review estimated colours and contrast ratios instead of measuring
     them. Recorded, not acted on: the loop's value includes knowing when NOT
     to change things.

10. qwen/qwen3-vl-8b-instruct -> REAL: my "— not fitted" label wrapped to 2 lines in
     the 2-col grid and misaligned the rows (FIXED: label shortened to a dash,
     full meaning moved to aria-label). Rest: radar sweep (5th false report),
     road bar overlap, constructor selected-row indicator (all present).
     NOTE: first pick from a re-filtered pool - content-safety/classifier models
     were excluded; they answer safety questions, not design ones.

11. google/gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview -> 2 REAL, both critiques of MY work:
     - beacon read as "oversized disconnected cyan arrow floating above the car",
       "jarring ... makes the objective feel like a UI overlay" (FIXED: smaller, sits
       low and close to the gate so it reads as a sign AT the building)
     - preview "lacks orientation markers on the actual chassis"; on a PRISTINE
       build no armour marks were drawn at all, so nothing showed where
       "Armor: Front" lives (FIXED: dashed ZONE outline always drawn, fill only
       where points were bought)
     This is the first reviewer in two rounds to score above zero, and both finds
     were regressions or mis-sjudgements of my own earlier iterations.

12. bytedance-seed/seed-2.0-code -> 1 REAL: tagline ~10-13px, too small to read at
     a glance (FIXED: 13-16px, brighter; hierarchy held by RELATIVE size against
     the 40-76px wordmark, not by making the tagline tiny - iteration 3 had
     overshot when it shrank the tagline to fix "three competing layers").
     Checked and FALSE: condition-panel section spacing (ARMOUR/TYRES/PLANT have
     rules and gaps), constructor row cramping (rows have clear rhythm).
     Radar sweep: 6th false report.

13. qwen/qwen3.6-35b-a3b -> 2 REAL:
     - speedometer secondary text (TIER/0.0 mi) tiny+dim (FIXED: one step larger,
       off the dimmest ink 4.61:1 -> 8.83:1, still subordinate to the speed figure)
     - "preview is just a blue rounded rectangle with a dotted line" -> claim
       WRONG at full res (wheels/cabin/bonnet/zones/nose all present) but the
       PERCEPTION was the finding: every part was a similar blue on a similar
       alpha so nothing separated. FIXED by darkening the hull so the parts
       contrast, rather than by adding more parts.
       THIS IS THE LOOP'S KEY LESSON, now twice: when a reviewer says a thing is
       absent, check at full res; when the check says present and they still
       could not see it, believe them about CONTRAST.
     Radar sweep: 7th false report.

14. qwen/qwen3.8-omni-flash -> 1 BIG REAL: MAGENTA FRINGE on every vehicle.
     "stray magenta mount tabs ... they look like debug hitboxes" - CONFIRMED, the
     most visible defect in the game. Root cause was NOT the keyer: chromaKey
     sets alpha=0 but leaves RGB at the key colour, and the per-kind ~10x
     downscale resamples NON-PREMULTIPLIED RGBA, so transparent magenta bleeds
     into every edge AFTER despill runs. Fix: zero RGB of near-invisible pixels
     before the resize. 4.12% -> 0.00% magenta on all three cars. Also widened
     despill to strong-cast opaque pixels (test updated to the new contract).
     Other findings: title-art palette mismatch, city street network, constructor
     row->diagram linking (all real, queued).

15. qwen/qwen3.5-flash-02-23 -> 2 REAL, 1 the sharpest UX criticism in the loop:
     - "The text 'CONFIRM' at the bottom left is styled identically to the
       adjacent stat labels (dim white text). It lacks any button treatment
       (border, background, highlight) and is easily mistaken for passive
       information ... players may hesitate or quit because the primary
       call-to-action is invisible." TRUE and the best of its kind: every other
       row on that pane is a VALUE and CONFIRM is the only thing the player can
       DO, yet it was rendered as another data row. It now carries the button
       treatment with --ui-accent used nowhere else in the pane, so the single
       saturated surface on the screen is the thing the screen exists to do.
     - tagline "extremely thin font weight ... loses definition" (FIXED: weight
       500 + tighter shadow. Size was fixed in iteration 12; WEIGHT is a
       separate lever and was never touched.)
     FALSE: "the player's vehicle sprite sits perfectly flat ... with no shadow
     or contact occlusion" - the car has a directional shadow in the shader and
     has had one since iteration 1. Radar: 8th false report.
     TOOLING (2 real fixes the failure exposed):
     - picked google/gemini-2.5-pro and got an EMPTY body with no error; the
       tool recorded nothing that would explain it. finish_reason is now saved
       so 'content_filter' is distinguishable from a harness bug.
     - this model burned 9000 tokens on preamble and was cut off mid-JSON, twice.
       max_tokens -> 16000 and the prompt now demands the reply START with "[".
     - the model picker also returned google/gemini-3-pro-image-preview, an
       image GENERATION model, because the exclusion pattern was `-image$` and
       that id ends in -preview. The pattern now matches the substring anywhere.

16. qwen/qwen3.5-plus-02-15 -> 1 REAL (the long-standing city-cohesion item):
     - "The building sprites appear to be photographic cutouts with varying
       lighting directions and perspectives, clashing with the flat, stylized
       car and map. It makes the world look like a collage of unrelated
       assets." CONFIRMED at full res - the buildings really were mixed-source
       art each carrying its own colour identity, scattered on a cool grey map.
       A multiply TINT cannot fix this: multiplying by a colour only darkens and
       shifts hue, and the mismatched SATURATION is exactly what survives. So
       there is now a real GRADED fragment path (SPRITE_KIND 3): desaturate,
       then pull toward the ground's cool slate AT THE SAME LUMINANCE, keeping
       each building's own light-to-dark modelling. Actors, the waypoint beacon
       and doormarkers stay ungraded so the orange car still reads as the focal
       point. 2 new tests pin the kind routing and the overloaded-slot packing.
     FALSE: "schematic lines very low contrast" - at full res the chassis is
       bright cyan on navy, which is the fix iteration 13 made. Perception class.
     Recorded: dashes on unfitted armour read as null data (a pristine build has
       no armour, so a dash is correct - an explicit caption would be clearer);
       the condition panel occupies road real estate (deliberate HUD choice).

TOOLING - the review harness got audited by its own failure this round:
     - the iteration-15 picker fix had been applied in an AD-HOC shell snippet,
       not in tools/review.mjs, so two copies of the filter already existed and
       had drifted. The filter now lives in ONE exported function that both
       --list and --pick call, and the tool marks what has been asked.
     - --pick's "already asked" set is parsed from the loop log, and the
       function THROWS if it cannot parse any ids. It shipped briefly as a
       try/catch returning [] around an unimported readFileSync, which reported
       "0 models asked" as if it were fact - the picker would then re-ask used
       models forever while looking perfectly healthy. The only safe response to
       "I do not know what has been asked" is to stop.
     - 75 models in the pool, 61 not yet asked.

DEFERRED (real, documented, not bugs):
- Ground blockiness: NEAREST sampler is REQUIRED (no atlas gutters, linear would
  bleed). Real fix = dedicated linear+repeat ground texture (load-time change).
- City daylight grade (my 0.6 ground tint is why it reads dim), street network,
  title-menu composition, 10 empty weapon rows.
